##Corporate Info
International Gum was a small start up company founded by Kevin Andrew Hoiland and incorporated on August 16th 2010 in the State of California. International Gum Inc also did business under the name "Intl Gum". The company headquarters were in San Diego, CA.

In November 2014, the company decided to shutdown and terminate the formal C corporation status. After Board and Shareholder approval, the company started closing all accounts and filing necessary paperwork. The Intl Gum website remained live and maintained as a free community site without payment processing and other overhead until June 2015 (at which point the site was shutdown and this repo made public).

##User Experience
Intl Gum Membership was always free, which allowed usesrs to vote, rank, and comment on gum, along with other special privileges.  Non members still had access to the site for viewing gum info.

Intl Gum Members also had the option of paying $8 for a monthly subscription, which delivered a variety of gums directly to their door every month via mail.

There were about 400 different gums cataloged for searching (for example via flavor), ranking, commenting, or just viewing various gum realted data points.  Intl Gum created a new system for scoring gum:
* Gumtation: How tempting is the presentation, name, packaging, advertising, etc? 
* Chewlasticity: How is the size, texture, and flavor, both initially and over time? 
* Flavoracity: How accurate is the flavor? 
* Bubbability: How's the bubble blowing ability? 
* Gumalicious: How enjoyable and delicious is this gum?
